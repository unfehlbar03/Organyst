## Getting Started

First, install the packages used in the app:

```bash
yarn i
or
yarn
```
Now run the expo server:

```bash
expo start
```

To remove dependency warnings:

```bash
expo doctor --fix-dependencies
```

To run the app you will need an android or iOS simulator, or else you can directly run it on you mobile using the Expo Go Application.
